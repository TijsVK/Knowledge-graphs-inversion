% In this thesis, we will explore the field of few-shot object detection to find out if recent advancements in the field have made it performant enough to be able to detect and count shells on a beach.

% Few-shot object detection is a newer field of research in computer vision that has been gaining traction in the last few years. 
% As opposed to the related field of image classification, where the goal is to classify an image into a class, object detection aims to detect and classify objects in an image. This is a more complicated task, as the network has to not only classify the objects but also localize the objects in the image. In addition the limitation of not having a lot of images of the objects to work with results in not having sufficient information on the objects to detect them. The only way to achieve reliable detection is to make up for the gap in our knowledge in a different way. This is where the field of few-shot object detection comes in. It allows us to first gain generic knowledge by learning from a large dataset and then fine-tuning that knowledge to our specific task by learning from a small dataset.
