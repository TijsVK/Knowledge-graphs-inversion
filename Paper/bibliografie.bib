  abstract={This article is a follow-up to an earlier paper byMarchi andMiguel [1974] in which a mathematical structure for the teaching-learning process has been developed. Now, possible paths for teaching in a given knowledge set and the possible choices open to different teachers and groups of students are investigated. Furthermore, considering that teachers and students are in an interactive situation, an optimal global procedure corresponds exactly to the concept of equilibrium point. The existence proof gives rise to a constructive algorithm which would allow using the results for practical applications.},

However, there is no overview of existing approaches for generating knowledge graphs from heterogeneous (semi-)structured data, making it difficult to select the right one for a certain use case. To support better decision making, we study the existing approaches for generating knowledge graphs from heterogeneous (semi-)structured data relying on mapping languages. In this paper, we investigated existing mapping languages for schema and data transformations, and corresponding materialization and virtualization systems that generate knowledge graphs. We gather and unify 52 articles regarding knowledge graph generation from heterogeneous (semi-)structured data. We assess 15 characteristics on mapping languages for schema transformations, 5 characteristics for data transformations, and 14 characteristics for systems. Our survey paper provides an overview of the mapping languages and systems proposed the past two decades. Our work paves the way towards a better adoption of knowledge graph generation, as the right mapping language and system can be selected for each use case.}

  abstract={One promise of Semantic Web applications is to seamlessly deal with heterogeneous data. The Extensible Markup Language (XML) has become widely adopted as an almost ubiquitous interchange format for data, along with transformation languages like XSLT and XQuery to translate data from one XML format into another. However, the more recent Resource Description Framework (RDF) has become another popular standard for data representation and exchange, supported by its own query language SPARQL, that enables extraction and transformation of RDF data. Being able to work with XML and RDF using a common framework eliminates several unnecessary steps that are currently required when handling both formats side by side. In this paper we present the XSPARQL language that, by combining XQuery and SPARQL, allows to query XML and RDF data using the same framework and transform data from one format into the other. We focus on the semantics of this combined language and present an implementation, including discussion of query optimisations along with benchmark evaluation.},

  abstract="Linked Data is often generated based on a set of declarative rules using languages such as R2RML and RML. These languages are built with machine-processability in mind. It is thus not always straightforward for users to define or understand rules written in these languages, preventing them from applying the desired annotations to the data sources. In the past, graphical tools were proposed. However, next to users who prefer a graphical approach, there are users who desire to understand and define rules via a text-based approach. For the latter, we introduce an enhancement to their workflow. Instead of requiring users to manually write machine-processable rules, we propose writing human-friendly rules, and generate machine-processable rules based on those human-friendly rules. At the basis is YARRRML: a human-readable text-based representation for declarative generation rules. We propose a novel browser-based integrated development environment (IDE) called Matey, showcasing the enhanced workflow. In this work, we describe our demo. Users can experience first hand how to generate triples from data in different formats by using YARRRML's representation of the rules. The actual machine-processable rules remain completely hidden when editing. Matey shows that writing human-friendly rules enhances the workflow for a broader range of users. As a result, more desired annotations will be added to the data sources which leads to more desired Linked Data.",

abstract = {Publishing data sources to knowledge graphs is a complicated and laborious process as data sources are often heterogeneous, hierarchical and interlinked. As an example, food price datasets may contain product prices of various units at different markets and times, and different providers can have many choices of formats such as CSV, JSON or spreadsheet. Beyond data formats, these datasets may have differing layout, where one dataset may be organized as a row-based table or relational table (prices are in one column), while another may use a matrix table (prices are in one matrix). To address these problems, we present a novel data description language for mapping datasets to RDF. In particular, our language supports specifying the locations of source attributes in the sources, mapping of the attributes to ontologies, and simple rules to join the data of these attributes to output final RDF triples. Unlike existing approaches, our language is not restricted to specific data layouts such as the Nested Relational Model, or to specific data formats, such as spreadsheet. Our broad data description language presents a format-independent solution, allowing interlinking among multiple heterogeneous sources and representing many diverse data structures that existing tools are unable to handle.},

  abstractnote = {&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ontology-based data access focuses on enabling query evaluation over heterogeneous relational databases according to the model represented by an ontology. The relationships between the ontology and the data sources are commonly defined with declarative mappings, which are used by systems to perform SPARQL-to-SQL query translation or to generate RDF dumps from the relational databases. Besides the potential homogenization of data because of using an ontology, some additional advantages of this paradigm are that it may allow applying reasoning thanks to the ontology, as well as querying for meta knowledge, which describes statements with information such as provenance or certainty. In this paper, (i) we adapt a widely used RDF graph store benchmark, namely LUBM, for ontology-based data access, (ii) extend the benchmark for the evaluation of queries that exploit meta knowledge, and (iii) apply it for performance evaluation of state-of-the-art declarative mapping systems. Our proposal, the LUBM4OBDA Benchmark, considers inference capabilities that are not covered by previous ontology-based data access benchmarks, and it is the first one for the evaluation of meta knowledge and the RDF-star data model. The experimental evaluation shows that current virtualization systems cannot handle some advanced inference tasks, and that optimizations are needed to scale RDF-star materialization.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},
