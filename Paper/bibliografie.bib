  abstract={This article is a follow-up to an earlier paper byMarchi andMiguel [1974] in which a mathematical structure for the teaching-learning process has been developed. Now, possible paths for teaching in a given knowledge set and the possible choices open to different teachers and groups of students are investigated. Furthermore, considering that teachers and students are in an interactive situation, an optimal global procedure corresponds exactly to the concept of equilibrium point. The existence proof gives rise to a constructive algorithm which would allow using the results for practical applications.},

  abstract = {More and more data in various formats are integrated into knowledge graphs. However, there is no overview of existing approaches for generating knowledge graphs from heterogeneous (semi-)structured data, making it difficult to select the right one for a certain use case. To support better decision making, we study the existing approaches for generating knowledge graphs from heterogeneous (semi-)structured data relying on mapping languages. In this paper, we investigated existing mapping languages for schema and data transformations, and corresponding materialization and virtualization systems that generate knowledge graphs. We gather and unify 52 articles regarding knowledge graph generation from heterogeneous (semi-)structured data. We assess 15 characteristics on mapping languages for schema transformations, 5 characteristics for data transformations, and 14 characteristics for systems. Our survey paper provides an overview of the mapping languages and systems proposed the past two decades. Our work paves the way towards a better adoption of knowledge graph generation, as the right mapping language and system can be selected for each use case.}

  abstract={One promise of Semantic Web applications is to seamlessly deal with heterogeneous data. The Extensible Markup Language (XML) has become widely adopted as an almost ubiquitous interchange format for data, along with transformation languages like XSLT and XQuery to translate data from one XML format into another. However, the more recent Resource Description Framework (RDF) has become another popular standard for data representation and exchange, supported by its own query language SPARQL, that enables extraction and transformation of RDF data. Being able to work with XML and RDF using a common framework eliminates several unnecessary steps that are currently required when handling both formats side by side. In this paper we present the XSPARQL language that, by combining XQuery and SPARQL, allows to query XML and RDF data using the same framework and transform data from one format into the other. We focus on the semantics of this combined language and present an implementation, including discussion of query optimisations along with benchmark evaluation.},

  abstract="Linked Data is often generated based on a set of declarative rules using languages such as R2RML and RML. These languages are built with machine-processability in mind. It is thus not always straightforward for users to define or understand rules written in these languages, preventing them from applying the desired annotations to the data sources. In the past, graphical tools were proposed. However, next to users who prefer a graphical approach, there are users who desire to understand and define rules via a text-based approach. For the latter, we introduce an enhancement to their workflow. Instead of requiring users to manually write machine-processable rules, we propose writing human-friendly rules, and generate machine-processable rules based on those human-friendly rules. At the basis is YARRRML: a human-readable text-based representation for declarative generation rules. We propose a novel browser-based integrated development environment (IDE) called Matey, showcasing the enhanced workflow. In this work, we describe our demo. Users can experience first hand how to generate triples from data in different formats by using YARRRML's representation of the rules. The actual machine-processable rules remain completely hidden when editing. Matey shows that writing human-friendly rules enhances the workflow for a broader range of users. As a result, more desired annotations will be added to the data sources which leads to more desired Linked Data.",
