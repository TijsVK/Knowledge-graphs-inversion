\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{chapter:evaluation}
In this chapter we will evaluate our implementation. We will do this by testing it again various datasets, comparing the expected results with the actual results. For each dataset we will go over our testing methodology and its results. 
\section{RML test cases}
\label{section:rml_test_cases}
The RML test cases are a set of test cases to evaluate the conformity of an RML processor. Though these test cases are not a perfect match, they offer expected outputs for certain inputs and mapping rules, making them a good starting point for testing our implementation. Tests that error do not produce a result, so we start by filtering those out.
